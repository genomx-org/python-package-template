## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English or Spanish.

## Policy

A Policy consists of high-level statements relating to the protection of information across the organization and should be produced and ratified by management. A documented policy is frequently
a requirement to satisfy regulations or laws, such as those relating to privacy and copyright . It is an organizational mandate.

## Standards

Standards consist of specific low level mandatory controls that help enforce and support the information security policy. Standards help to ensure security consistency across the business and
usually contain security controls relating to the implementation of specific technology, hardware, or software.

## Guidelines

Guidelines consist of recommended, non-mandatory controls that help support standards or serve as a reference when no applicable standard is in place. Guidelines should be viewed as best practices
that are not usually requirements but are strongly recommended. They could consist of additional recommended controls that support a standard, or help fill in the gaps where no specific standard applies.

## Procedures

Procedures consist of step-by-step instructions to assist workers in implementing the various policies, standards, and guidelines. While the policies, standards and guidelines consist of the
controls that should be in place, a procedure gets down to specifics, explaining how to implement these controls in a step-by-step fashion.
